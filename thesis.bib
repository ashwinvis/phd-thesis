  abstract = {Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the Navier Stokes equations is an invaluable research tool in fluid dynamics. Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral DNS code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the MPI domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the KAUST supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and FFT routines have been implemented in Python using serial FFT routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial FFT module), NumPy array manipulations and with MPI communications handled by MPI for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel FFT in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the FFTW library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.},

Questions about which language is more succinct or efficient, or makes developers more productive are discussed with fervor, and their answers are too often based on anecdotes and unsubstantiated beliefs. In this study, we use the largely untapped research potential of Rosetta Code, a code repository of solutions to common programming tasks in various languages, which offers a large data set for analysis. Our study is based on 7'087 solution programs corresponding to 745 tasks in 8 widely used languages representing the major programming paradigms (procedural: C and Go, object-oriented: C\# and Java, functional: F\# and Haskell, scripting: Python and Ruby). Our statistical analysis reveals, most notably, that: functional and scripting languages are more concise than procedural and object-oriented languages, C is hard to beat when it comes to raw speed on large inputs, but performance differences over inputs of moderate size are less pronounced and allow even interpreted languages to be competitive, compiled strongly-typed languages, where more defects can be caught at compile time, are less prone to runtime failures than interpreted or weakly-typed languages. We discuss implications of these results for developers, language designers, and educators.},

I illustrate this transformation using a framework of process and product factors, and discuss how the bazaar metaphor, which up to now has been associated with the open source development process, has actually shifted to become a metaphor better suited to the OSS 2.0 product delivery and support process. Overall the OSS 2.0 phenomenon is significantly different from its free software antecedent. Its emergence accentuates the fundamental alteration of the basic ground rules in the software landscape, signifying the end of the proprietary-driven model that has prevailed for the past 20 years or so. Thus, a clear understanding of the characteristics of the emergent OSS 2.0 phenomenon is required to address key challenges for research and practice.},

  abstract = {The development of computer models for numerical simulation of the atmosphere 
and oceans is one of the great scientific triumphs of the past fifty years. These 
models have added enormously to our understanding of the complex processes in 
the atmosphere and oceans. The consequences for humankind of ongoing climate 
change will be far-reaching. Earth system models are the best means we have of 
predicting the future of our climate. 
 
The basic ideas of numerical forecasting and climate modeling were developed 
about a century ago, long before the first electronic computer was constructed. 
However, advances on several fronts were necessary before numerical prediction 
could be put into practice. A fuller understanding of atmospheric dynamics allowed 
the development of simplified systems of equations; regular observations of the 
free atmosphere provided the initial conditions; stable finite difference schemes 
were developed; and powerful electronic computers provided a practical means of 
carrying out the calculations required to predict the changes in the weather. 
 
In this chapter, we trace the history of computer forecasting from Richardson’s 
prodigious manual computation, through the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical 
Integrator and Computer) integrations to the early days of operational numerical 
weather prediction and climate modeling. The useful range of deterministic prediction 
is increasing by about one day each decade. We set the scene for the story 
of the remarkable progress in weather forecasting and in climate modeling over 
the past fifty years, which will be treated in subsequent chapters.},
